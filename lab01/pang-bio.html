Hi, my name is Xinglai Pang, and I am a student in iSchool of Syracuse University. My major is Information Management and Technology, and I have a concentration in cybersecurity.

Besides my studies and career, I have a wide range of hobbies, but first I am a gamer. I like to play games, I play over 70% of the major games in the market. I like history as well. The 19th to 20th century is my favorite. I like Formula 1 as well, I like to race cars, though I never tried once in real life. Anyway I stay with my computers for most of my life.
